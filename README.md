# GRF_exercise
Gaussian Random Field simple exercise
These are the notes and files to,
1. Read a delta(x) field and compute the associated power spectrum
2. Given a power spectrum shape, generate a Gaussian random field which represents the input power spectrum.
Since no delta(x) file is provided for the exercise 1, you might want to run the excercise 2 first, or to download such delta(x) file from the link provided in the pdf file.
